TODO

* find a more supported base box (ubuntu with gnome desktop)
* preconfigure CATALINA_HOME variable (gets overwritten at first intellij startup)
* gsettings command in user_setup script doesn't work (would vbox.gui=true help?)
* convert scripts to chef recipe
* convert to using packer
* fix semi-colons in paths in debug configurations
* preconfigure intellij jdk
* release 17.3 build (or just enlist in trunk and release 17.3?)
